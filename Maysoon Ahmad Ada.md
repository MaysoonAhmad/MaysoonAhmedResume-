Dear Hiring Manager:



Please accept my resume in consideration for the position with your company. I’m a University of Waterloo alumni with a Master of Applied Sciences degree in Chemical Engineering.  



I have a passion to do programming since I was doing my master, so I started working hard to learn more in python. I am planning to be certified in CS.



I got an opportunity to work on a project which integrates my chemical engineering background and enhances my software skills. The project target was to help human to predict the air pollution sources. I am looking for an opportunity to enhance the idea by leveraging software module to analyze the data and predict a strategy to help environmental engineers to make the right decision about how to control the hazard resourcing. 



I am looking forward to using my technical engineering skills, root-cause-analysis, strong analytical, statistical data analysis, and strong problem-solving skills. Within me, you will discover a reliable, detail-oriented and extremely hard worker. I am a team worker with an open mindset. 



It would be a great pleasure to listen and speak with you.



Kind regards,



Maysoon Ahmad

EMPLOYMENT HISTORY

------------------ 



### Assistant teacher at Lake Washington School district, February 2019 ###

Responsibilities

----------------

* Assist in developing lesson plans based on state requirements and the specific needs of each child.

* Work with children in the classroom to promote their learning and development

* Communicate with parents and keep them informed about their child’s development and any changes to the regular day-to-day schedule



### Waterloo university, Canada ON, Master and PhD (drop out),  2009 - 2014 ###

Responsibilities

----------------

* Air quality forecasting project: an integrated Analysis of the air pollution forcing using Calpuff and python: The project target was to analysis a raw data for air pollutants (mixture of gases) from different factories in Ontario area. We used python to parse and filter the requirement data in order to use it as an input for Calpuff(dispersion model). Calpuff support AI to predict air pollution. The module can be use as future project to simulate environment hazard prediction. AI and ML (machine learning) can be used as tools to monitor and reserve air quality .AI and ML will help human to predict pollution and track pollution sources. 

* Assessment of mathematical models for Ultrafiltration of multi-solute continuous cross-flow process using MATLAB.

* Simulate the treatment of Industrial Phenolic Liquid Effluents using MATLAB.

* Odour assesment project: Applying Calpuff(dispersion model)to quantify the odour potential impact in the environment of a proposed facility in the Carp, Ontario . Where CALPUFF used to simulate the dispersion and to get predicted concentration.
